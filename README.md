**Note:**
Tempo detection is currently optimized for music with strong rhythmic / percussive elements in quadruple, 6/8 time signatures, performance may vary on other inputs. Works best with live music and low background noise. Currently using [TempiBeatDetection](https://github.com/CheckThisCodeCarefully/TempiBeatDetection) by John Scalo. I plan to improve the algorithm, collaborators welcome.

**Coming soon in future updates**
- tempo dynamic gauge (speed up / slow down)
